# Face Mask Segmentation 
### Project Description:
-the goal is to build a Face Mask Segmentation model
which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an 
- In this problem, we use "Transfer Learning" of an Image Segmentation model to detect any object according to the problem in hand.
  

# Data Description:
- WIDER FACE dataset is a Face Mask Segmentation benchmark dataset, of which
images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset.
This data have 32,203 images and 393,703 faces are labeled with a high degree of
variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images.
In this project, we are using 409 images and around 1000 faces for ease of
computation.
